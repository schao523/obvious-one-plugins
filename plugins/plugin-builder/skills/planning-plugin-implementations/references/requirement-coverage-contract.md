# Requirement coverage contract

Create one row per approved requirement with these fields:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| requirement_id | Stable ID from the approved design |
| behavior | Preserved observable outcome |
| implementation_owner | Skill, reference, deterministic contract, or adapter |
| evidence_target | Specific static check, scenario, or runtime observation |
| evidence_state | Current honest state |
| notes | Constraint, dependency, or unresolved decision |

Do not merge IDs, omit inconvenient requirements, or count a reference link as behavior evidence. Use `EXPECTED` for a defined future outcome, `STATICALLY VERIFIED` for inspected structure/content, `RUNTIME VERIFIED` only for directly observed execution, and `NOT VERIFIED` when no applicable test ran. Runtime exclusions are recorded separately as `NOT APPLICABLE`.

Each implementation owner must trace back to at least one requirement, and every required dependency must have an availability/rights decision before packaging.
# Application-tool coverage

Every required tool maps to at least one approved requirement and one owning skill. Its contract and binding identities are part of the W1 plan hash. Missing, conflicting, unbound, or unresolved required tool behavior returns to design approval; it is not inferred from a filename.
