# Tool evidence contract

Verify each declared application tool independently and preserve its contract hash, fixture hash, requirement bindings, skill bindings, implementation kind, execution state, and diagnostics in the W2 report.

For `BUNDLED_LOCAL` and `FRAMEWORK_ADAPTER`, execute only an approved direct argument vector with `shell=false`, a bounded timeout, a clean environment, and network disabled unless separately authorized. Record return state plus SHA-256 digests of stdout and stderr; do not embed potentially sensitive process output.

For `RUNTIME_NATIVE` and `MCP_ADAPTER`, report `NOT VERIFIED` when the target capability, user configuration, credentials, or authorized service connection is unavailable. Never synthesize a runtime pass from static configuration.

A required tool with a blocking fallback must pass before W2 can be approved or a ZIP emitted. An approved optional tool may remain `NOT VERIFIED` when the owning requirement has other passing required evidence, but its limitation must remain visible through W2 and packaging.
