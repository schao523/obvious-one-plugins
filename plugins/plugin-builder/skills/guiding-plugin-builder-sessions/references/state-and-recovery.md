# State and recovery

Persist only the minimum local state required to resume:

- application identity and approved specification digest;
- explicit create/update mode and relative baseline identity when applicable;
- current workflow state and recorded W1/W2 decisions;
- requirement coverage, candidate identity, and evidence rows;
- unresolved decisions and relative artifact locations.

Do not persist private absolute source paths, credentials, conversation history, or source document contents when a digest and relative identifier suffice.

On pause, stop all mutation and record `H1_PAUSED`. On resume, validate the state schema and referenced identities, summarize completed work and unresolved decisions, then return to the recorded state. If an identity changed or state is corrupt, do not guess; return to intake or the last independently verified checkpoint. On cancel, mark `E2_CANCELLED` and create no artifact.
# State operations

`pause` stores the prior stage and enters `H1`; `resume` restores that recorded stage; `cancel` enters `E2`. These operations change session state only and do not delete candidates, reports, packages, or approved inputs. Summarize the restored or cancelled state in plain language and ask at most one blocking question.
