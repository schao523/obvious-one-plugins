# Runtime compatibility evidence

Phase-one runtime scope is `OPENAI_ONLY_PHASE_ONE`.

| Runtime | Evidence state | Environment identity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Codex | RUNTIME VERIFIED | Primitive feasibility only; Codex Desktop local projectless task; codex-cli 0.146.0 |
| ChatGPT Work Local/Desktop | RUNTIME VERIFIED | Primitive feasibility only; user-confirmed native local execution; returned artifact independently inspected |
| Generated standalone Plugin Builder artifact | RUNTIME VERIFIED | Local clean-process T7 create/update execution with repository paths removed from the environment |
| Codex installed Plugin Builder execution | NOT VERIFIED | No installed-plugin T1–T7 execution recorded |
| ChatGPT Work Local/Desktop Plugin Builder execution | NOT VERIFIED | No installed-plugin T1–T7 execution recorded |
| OpenClaw | NOT APPLICABLE | Explicitly excluded from phase one |
| Claude | NOT APPLICABLE | Explicitly excluded from phase one |

## Feasibility capabilities

| Capability | Codex | ChatGPT Work Local/Desktop |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Read the approved normalized package | PASS | PASS |
| Create an isolated workspace | PASS | PASS |
| Write a minimal plugin | PASS | PASS |
| Execute the bundled deterministic validator | PASS | PASS |
| Generate and return a ZIP | PASS | PASS |

Both returned ZIPs were independently checked for their reported SHA-256, exact member closure, safe paths, valid manifest, embedded PASS result, approved input identity, and absence of Workbench imports. This evidence proves required runtime primitives only; it does not prove the Plugin Builder acceptance scenarios end to end.

## Repository-local phase-two verification

The repository-local implementation directly exercises T1–T6, pause/resume/cancel, canonical v1.1 and retained recognized-legacy intake, bundled local tools, optional runtime-native and MCP evidence, portable wrapped ZIPs, digest-closed evidence packaging, and T7 from the generated artifact. Direct Design Assistant-to-Builder interoperability covers full/create and delta/update without manual sidecar repair. These results prove local application execution, not installed runtime discovery.

| Gate | Command or observation | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Product contracts | `python -B -m unittest discover -s applications/plugin-builder/tests -v` | PASS: 157 tests; one native-symlink test skipped because Windows lacks the required privilege, with reparse classification covered separately |
| Repository discovery | `python -B -m unittest tests.test_application_config tests.test_agents_contract -v` | PASS: 10 tests |
| Plugin structure | framework `validate_plugin_tree` on source and extracted install artifact, plus installed Plugin Creator 0.1.22 package-format review | PASS: both executable validations returned no issues; the Plugin Creator review is a static contract review, not a separate executable validator |
| Skill structure | installed Skill Creator `quick_validate.py` for each of four source skills and each extracted-artifact skill | PASS: 8 of 8 |
| Framework | `python -B -m unittest discover -s tests/framework -v` | PASS: 321 tests; 2 platform skips |
| Workbench handoff interoperability | `python -B -m unittest tests.test_workbench_handoff_interoperability -v` | PASS: 4 tests; full/create and delta/update reach S2 without repair, preserving canonical records, UTF-8 source bytes, baseline identity, unaffected baseline content, and repeat ZIP identity |
| Configured verification | `python -B scripts/verify_extraction.py --application plugin-builder` | PASS: provenance, product commands, local Codex build, deterministic schema-v3 package builds, verification, and repository gates |
| Generated Codex artifact | two isolated `build_marketplace_release.py` builds, deterministic host-upload ZIP construction, extracted plugin/skill validation, canonical full/delta intake, and T7 | PASS: 60 members with `plugin.json` at the upload ZIP root, synchronized root and compatibility manifests, vendored shared handoff runtime, no forbidden internal members, byte-identical release manifests and upload ZIPs, standalone create/update execution |
| Generated create/update plugins | extracted T7-style create and update ZIPs validated with framework `validate_plugin_tree` and installed Skill Creator `quick_validate.py` | PASS: both plugin trees returned no issues and both generated skills passed |

The configured verifier's schema-v3 bundle construction is package-contract evidence only. It is not OpenClaw discovery or execution evidence and does not change OpenClaw from `NOT APPLICABLE` in the approved phase-one scope.

The CLI commands are `status`, `validate-session`, `inspect`, `plan`, `approve-w1`, `resolve-update`, `build`, `verify`, `approve-w2`, `package`, `package-runtime-evidence`, `pause`, `resume`, and `cancel`; each operational command emits one machine-readable result document. Installed-plugin discovery, installed representative execution, and application conversation behavior remain `NOT VERIFIED`.

No marketplace installation, publication, upload, universal-directory submission, tag, or release is recorded for Plugin Builder. All remain `NOT_PERFORMED` pending separate owner authorization.

## Installed-runtime completion boundary

The exact replay contract is tracked at `tests/runtime/T1-T7-runtime-scenarios.md` with a machine-checkable result schema. A self-contained runtime kit and deterministic installable ZIP are generated under `dist/plugin-builder` for decision-owner testing. The kit includes raw legacy and canonical handoffs, exact T3/T5/T6 proposals, and a deterministic helper that derives the T4 baseline and update plan from the T2 ZIP. This development task can verify the generated artifact in an isolated clean process, but it cannot infer installed plugin discovery or ChatGPT Work execution from that local copy.

Current compatibility classification: `CONDITIONALLY PORTABLE`. Current completion state: `CONVERSION COMPLETE — RUNTIME VALIDATION PENDING`. Codex installed-plugin and ChatGPT Work Local/Desktop application rows stay `NOT VERIFIED`; runtime-native and MCP tool execution also stays `NOT VERIFIED` unless the named capability or service is actually authorized and observed. Publication remains `NOT PERFORMED`.
